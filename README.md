# wireframing.
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure
# Types of wire frames 
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.
# Brief overview of figma
In most cases, as a frontend developer in software development, you will receive a complete set of mockup designs from the UI/UX design team. These designs are usually well thought out, providing you with an idea of what the end product will look like and all the assets you will need for implementing the UI
# Benefits of wireframing
# Clarifies Ideas and Concepts:
Wireframing helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a project early in the process.

# Facilitates Communication:
It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.

# Identifies Usability Issues:
By focusing on the user interface structure, wireframing helps identify potential usability issues early on. This can include navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.

# Saves Time and Resources:
Early detection of design flaws and usability issues saves time and resources that would be spent on revisions later in the design and development stages.

# Provides a Clear Layout and Structure:
Wireframes provide a clear and simple representation of the layout, allowing designers to plan the content placement and prioritize elements effectively.

# Enables Easy Modifications:
Making changes to a wireframe is quicker and less costly than altering a high-fidelity design or a developed product. This flexibility encourages experimentation and iterative improvement.

# Guides the Design Process:
Wireframes act as a guide for subsequent design and development phases, ensuring that the final product aligns with the initial vision and requirements.

# Focuses on Functionality and User Experience:
By stripping away visual design elements, wireframes allow designers to concentrate on the functionality and user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and user-friendly.

# Real world scenario
the use of figma will be to represent codes in the most simplest visual form such as car racing games, facebook, twitter and the like
